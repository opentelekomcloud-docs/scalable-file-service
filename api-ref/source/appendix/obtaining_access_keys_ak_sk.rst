#. In the navigation pane, select **Access Keys**.
#. Click **Create Access Key** to go to the **Create Access Key** page.
#. Enter a description (optional) and click **OK**.
#. Click **Download** to obtain the access key file.

   .. note::

      Keep the AK/SK file properly to prevent information leakage.
