What Is SFS?
============

Scalable File Service (SFS) provides scalable, high-performance file storage. With SFS, you can enjoy shared file access spanning multiple ECSs. SFS supports the Network File System (NFS) protocol. You can seamlessly integrate existing applications and tools with the service.

SFS provides an easy-to-use graphical user interface (GUI). On the GUI, users can create and configure file systems, saving effort in deploying, resizing, and optimizing file systems.

In addition, SFS features high availability. It can be elastically expanded, and it performs better as its capacity grows. The service is suitable for a wide range of scenarios, including media processing, file sharing, content management and web services, big data, and analytic applications.
