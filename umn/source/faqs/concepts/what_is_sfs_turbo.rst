What Is SFS Turbo?
==================

SFS Turbo enables high-performance file storage that can be expanded and shrunk on demand. It provides file sharing services for Elastic Cloud Servers (ECSs). SFS Turbo supports the Network File System (NFS) protocol (only NFSv3). You can seamlessly integrate existing applications and tools with the service.

SFS Turbo provides an easy-to-use graphical user interface (GUI). On the GUI, users can create and configure file systems, saving effort in deploying, resizing, and optimizing file systems.

In addition, SFS Turbo features high reliability and availability. It can be elastically expanded, and it performs better as its capacity grows. The service is suitable for a wide range of scenarios, including enterprise office, high-performance websites, and software development.
