Can a File System Be Mounted to Multiple Accounts?
==================================================

SFS Capacity-Oriented file systems can be mounted across accounts.

General purpose file systems cannot be mounted across accounts.

SFS Turbo file systems can be mounted across accounts based on VPC peering. For details about VPC peering connection and usage instructions, see section "VPC Peering Connection" in *Virtual Private Cloud User Guide*.
