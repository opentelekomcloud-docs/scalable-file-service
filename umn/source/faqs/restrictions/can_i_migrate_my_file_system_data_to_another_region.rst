Can I Migrate My File System Data to Another Region?
====================================================

Cross-region migration of file system data is currently not supported for SFS Capacity-Oriented and general purpose file systems. It is recommended that you select an appropriate region when purchasing a file system. Alternatively, you can copy the data to a local device and transfer it to another region.

SFS Turbo supports cross-region data migration. You can use Cloud Connect to connect VPCs across regions and then mount the file system and migrate the data.
