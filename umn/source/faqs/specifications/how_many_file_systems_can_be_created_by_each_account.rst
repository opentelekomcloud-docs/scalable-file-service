How Many File Systems Can Be Created by Each Account?
=====================================================

Currently, a maximum of 10 SFS Capacity-Oriented file systems and 10 SFS Turbo file systems can be created by each cloud account.

-  SFS Capacity-Oriented file systems can be created in batches. To create more than 10 SFS Capacity-Oriented file systems, click **Increase quota** on the page for creating a file system.
-  Only one SFS Turbo file system can be created at a time. To create more than 10 SFS Turbo file systems, contact customer service to apply for a higher quota. For details, see `How Do I Apply for a Higher Quota? <https://docs.otc.t-systems.com/en-us/faq/iaas/en-us_topic_0040259342.html>`__
