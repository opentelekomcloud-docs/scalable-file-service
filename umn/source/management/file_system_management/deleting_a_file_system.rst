Deleting a File System
======================

Data in a deleted file system cannot be restored. Ensure that files in a file system have been properly stored or backed up before you delete the file system.

Prerequisites
-------------

The file system to be deleted has been unmounted. For details about how to unmount the file system, see :ref:`Unmount a File System <sfs_01_0026>`.

Procedure
---------

#. Log in to SFS Console.

#. In the file system list, locate the file system you want to delete and click **Delete** in the **Operation** column.

   If you want to delete more than one file system at a time, select the file systems, and then click **Delete** in the upper left part of the file system list. In the displayed dialog box, confirm the information, enter **Delete** in the text box, and then click **Yes**. Batch deletion is only supported for SFS Capacity-Oriented file systems.

#. In the displayed dialog box, as shown in :ref:`Figure 1 <en-us_topic_0000001515917216__fig51368710153938>`, confirm the information and then click **Yes**.

   .. note::

      Only **Available** and **Unavailable** file systems can be deleted.
