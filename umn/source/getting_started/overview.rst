Overview
========

This section describes how to use SFS.

After creating a file system, you cannot directly access the file system. Instead, you need to mount the file system to ECSs.

:ref:`Figure 1 <sfs_01_0162__fig1830989795513>` shows the process for creating and mounting an SFS Turbo file system.

:ref:`Figure 2 <sfs_01_0162__fig198881945142515>` shows the process for creating and mounting an SFS Capacity-Oriented file system.

:ref:`Figure 3 <sfs_01_0162__fig22161519194012>` shows the process for creating and mounting a general purpose file system.
